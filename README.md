<h1>EditRadiaCodeAccuracy</h1><p>This script loads data from a tab-delimited file, removes lines that have accuracy above a specified threshold, and saves the resulting data to a new file. The script also calculates and prints the average, minimum, and maximum accuracy in the input file when loading and the output file after saving.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><ul><li>Python 3.6 or later</li><li>The <code>csv</code> module (included with Python)</li></ul><h2>Usage</h2><p>To run the script, use the following command:</p><pre><div class="bg-black mb-4 rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre-wrap hljs">python EditRadiaCodeAccuracy.py input_file output_file threshold
